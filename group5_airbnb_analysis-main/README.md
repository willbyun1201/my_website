# Executive Summary

The goal of this analysis is to find a model that helps us to predict rental prices for Airbnbs in Berlin. For this, we consider a data set of c. 18.3k rentals in the city. Using statistical tools, we identify the following variables as significant drivers of price: (i) number of reviews, (ii) review scores rating, (iii) room type, (iv) nr. of bedrooms, (v) nr. of people the rental accommodates, (vi) host status (superhost/non-superhost), (vii) instant bookability, (viii) availability in the next 30 days, and (ix) location of the rental. We also find that while these variables are certainly helpful to explain some of the variability in price, there must also be other factors, which are not included in the underlying data. In the following report, we use a combination of text, R code, and visualizations to document the process of coming to these conclusions. Finally, we make some recommendations on how to further improve the analysis.
