# William Byun

My name is William Byun and I am ethnically South Korean. My Korean name is Young Hwan. However, I moved to the UK when I was 3 and have lived there ever since. I joined the LSE in 2018 where I completed my BSc Economics. Whilst studying at the LSE, I found my passion for Finance and decided to join the MFA at LBS in 2021. In the future, I hope to further my interest in the field of Finance by working at a hedge fund. 

My hobbies include: Data Analytics, Golf, Football and Travelling.
